# Overview
The software I wrote was in the Dart Language. In the code, I use two classes, have multiple control structures (IF and switch), and a loop.  It was interesting learning Dart and seeing how it was similar to langauges like Python or Javascript.  I found some things a little different with the langauge (like reciving input from the user from ther terminal), but it should not cause a problem later on since using the terminal is temporary.  

I decided to make a calculator program out of it.  The reason why I wanted to do this in the r terminal first, was because I wanted to learn the language and then later on enhance it by using Flutter to go along with it.  The basic functions that it can do is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Development Environment

The development tool I used was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  My goal is to make a working program that runs in the terminal.  Then with that program, I hope to be able to implement this code with flutter to make a calculator app.  Since I do not know flutter, I am not sure exactly how I would need to implement it.  That will be something to research and find out in the future.

The programming language I used for this project was Dart.  The reason for this is because flutter uses dart.  Dart is really similar to other languages like Javascript with a few minor differences.  I did not use any libraries in this project beside the input and output stream so I can display things in the terminal.
